# IOTA_Api_Java_Library
Simple Java WebAPI Library for the GoShimmer Software

## Disclaimer
Right now only the WebAPI is implemented

### Planned libraries for goshimmer plugins are:
- [X] Standard WepApi Calls

- [ ] TXStream Plugin (Most api calls let the node crash so this is in a waiting position)

- [ ] Broadcast -> see https://github.com/arne-fuchs/broadcast //Being implemented right now. See the ongoing pull request on goshimmer: https://github.com/iotaledger/goshimmer/pull/1662

Feel free to request more features!

This is a Pre-Release and does only some basic calls and might be buggy.
Documentation will follow.

## Donations
If you want to keep me motivated to do more open source stuff you can donate me some IOTA's. Even very small amounts makes me happy:
