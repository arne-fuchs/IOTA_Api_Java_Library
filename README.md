# IOTA_Api_Java_Library
Simple Java WebAPI Library for the GoShimmer Software

## Disclaimer
Right now only the WebAPI is implemented

### Planned libraries for goshimmer plugins are:
[x] Standard WepApi Calls
[] TXStream Plugin (Most api calls let the node crash so this is in a waiting position)
[] Broadcast -> see https://github.com/arne-fuchs/broadcast //Being implemented right now. See the ongoing pull request on goshimmer: https://github.com/iotaledger/goshimmer/pull/1662

Feel free to request more features!

This is a Pre-Release and does only some basic calls and might be buggy.
