# GoShimmer_Java_WebAPI_Library
Simple Java WebAPI Library for the GoShimmer Software

## Disclaimer
Right now only the WebAPI is implemented

### Planned libraries for goshimmer plugins are:
TXStream Plugin (Most api calls let the node crash)
Broadcast -> see https://github.com/arne-fuchs/broadcast

This is a Pre-Release and does only some basic rest api calls.
